With the [release of the newest version of Apple’s iOS](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/03/ios-11-3-is-available-today/), a four-year-old technology called [Progressive Web Applications](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) (PWAs) just became an overnight success.

Like the term [“Ajax” in 2005](http://adaptivepath.org/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/), the term “Progressive Web Application” is a buzzword applied to a handful of new technologies. Specifically, it’s the way that web browsers on desktop and mobile devices will now _grant their native-application powers to websites_.

Chrome and Firefox users on Android and Windows (yes, on the desktop!) have had [access to these features for some time](https://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers). Now that they’ve been released to iOS, those Progressive Web Application superpowers will quickly be _everywhere_!

And that means opportunities for you.

## What can my site do once it’s a Progressive Web App?

Once your site is running over a secure connection and you’ve added two pieces of code, you can:

- Make your website available offline.
- Make your site run just as quickly over 4G as it does over wifi.
- Get your site onto users’ home screens _without_ putting them through the app-store process.
- Did we mention the app store process? While you’re at it, you can save yourself the three weeks of hair-pulling since you won’t need app-store approval.
- Do all of the above using a _web_ tools, using _web_ skillsets, on a _web_ budget and a _web_ timeline. All managed in _just one code base_. Think how simple your Trello boards will get!

Soon, PWAs will be able to access Bluetooth. That will completely reshape how the Internet of Things works with the average user. _And that’s just getting started._

### Sound Interesting? Join us at the Philly PWA Meetup!

Maybe you’re a business stakeholder that wants to know how using Progressive Web Apps can reduce the cost of developing applications. Maybe you’re a product owner that dreams of releasing features with just one developer team instead of three. And maybe you’re a developer that wants to play with the big new box of toys that PWAs provide. Please join us at the [Philly Progressive Web App meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PWA-Philly/), and let’s explore what’s possible together!
